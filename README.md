# My Python Learning Journey üêç

Welcome to my Python learning repository! This project serves as a personal log to document my progress as I learn the Python programming language from scratch.

## About This Repository

I created this repo to:
* Track my daily progress.
* Store all my practice code, notes, and exercises.
* Build a portfolio of my learning journey.

## Current Focus

I am currently learning the fundamentals of Python. My goal is to master the basics and gradually move on to more advanced topics.

## Structure

This repository is organized into folders based on the topics I am learning.

* `Basics/` (Variables, Data Types, Operators)
* `Control_Flow/` (If/Else statements, Loops)
* `Data_Structures/` (Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, Sets)
* `Functions/`
* *(More folders will be added as I progress)*

## Goals

My long-term goal is to become proficient in Python and explore areas like Data Science, AI/ML].

Feel free to follow my journey!
